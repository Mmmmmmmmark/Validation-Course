## Anoconda Tutorial

### Introduction To Anaconda

Anaconda is an open-source distribution for python and R. It is used for data science, machine learning, deep learning, etc. With the availability of more than 300 libraries for data science, it becomes fairly optimal for any programmer to work on anaconda for data science.

Anaconda helps in simplified package management and deployment. Anaconda comes with a wide variety of tools to easily collect data from various sources using various machine learning and AI algorithms. It helps in getting an easily manageable environment setup which can deploy any project with the click of a single button.

Now that we know what anaconda is, let’s try to understand how we can install anaconda and set up an environment to work on our systems.

### Installation And Setup

To install anaconda go to https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution.

Choose a version suitable for you and click on download. Once you complete the download, open the setup. Follow the instructions in the setup. Don’t forget to click on add anaconda to my path environment variable. After finishing the installation, open anaconda prompt and type jupyter notebook.

Now that we know how to use anaconda for python lets take a look at how we can install various libraries in anaconda for any project.

### How To Install Python Libraries In Anaconda?

Open anaconda prompt and check if the package is already installed or not. 

Type $ pip list. It will shown all packages you have installed. If you want to install a package (eg. Numpy). Just type $ pip install numpy.

### Anaconda Navigator

Anaconda Navigator is a desktop GUI that comes with the anaconda distribution. It allows us to launch applications and manage conda packages, environment and without using command-line commands.



## Jupyter Notebook Tutorial

### What is Jupyter Notebook?

The Jupyter Notebook is an incredibly powerful tool for interactively developing and presenting data science projects. This article will walk you through how to use Jupyter Notebooks for data science projects and how to set it up on your local machine.

First, though: what is a “notebook”?

A notebook integrates code and its output into a single document that combines visualizations, narrative text, mathematical equations, and other rich media. In other words: it’s a single document where you can run code, display the output, and also add explanations, formulas, charts, and make your work more transparent, understandable, repeatable, and shareable.

Using Notebooks is now a major part of the data science workflow at companies across the globe. If your goal is to work with data, using a Notebook will speed up your workflow and make it easier to communicate and share your results.

Best of all, as part of the open source Project Jupyter, Jupyter Notebooks are completely free. You can download the software on its own, or as part of the Anaconda data science toolkit.

Although it is possible to use many different programming languages in Jupyter Notebooks, this article will focus on Python, as it is the most common use case. (Among R users, R Studio tends to be a more popular choice).
